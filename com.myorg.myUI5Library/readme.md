# UI5 Library `myUI5Library`

Insert the purpose of this project and some interesting info here...

## Requirements

* git client, Node.js

## Installation / Setup

```sh
npm i
```

## Usage

Start the control sample page in watch mode:

```sh
npm run watch
```
(In case of using `yarn` you might face errors running this command. This is known and can be solved as described [here](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-library/issues/2#issuecomment-1205624296))

This opens the example control sample page in a browser window and launches the project in watch mode, which triggers several things at once whenever any code is changed:
* A re-generation of the TypeScript interfaces for the controls (so TypeScript knows all the generated control methods)
* A transpilation of the TypeScript code to JavaScript
* A reload of the page displayed in the browser

This generator is based on the following sample: [https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-control-library](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-control-library).
